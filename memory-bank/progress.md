# Progress: RenHjem Landing Page

## What Works

*   Basic HTML structure and content.
*   CSS styling and responsive layout.
*   Header scroll effect.
*   Language switching functionality (Danish/English) with `localStorage` persistence.
*   Modal windows for booking and contact, including opening/closing logic and form handling (console log only).
*   SEO elements (`meta` tags, `schema.org`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`).

## What's Left to Build

*   Backend integration for form submissions (currently client-side only).
*   Potentially more advanced animations or interactive elements if required by future updates.
*   Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).

## Current Status

The landing page is fully functional as a static site with client-side interactivity. The core structure and features are implemented.

## Known Issues

*   Form submissions do not send data to a server; they only log to the console and show an alert. This is expected given the current static nature of the site.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision to keep the project static and client-side for quick deployment and simplicity.
*   Choice of vanilla JavaScript to minimize dependencies and optimize performance for a small project.
