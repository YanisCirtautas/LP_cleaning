# Active Context: RenHjem Landing Page

## Current Work Focus

Initializing the Memory Bank for the project.

## Recent Changes

*   Initial analysis of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
*   Created `memory-bank` directory.
*   Created `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps

1.  Create the remaining core Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2.  Populate these files with the initial content as outlined in the plan.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   The project is a simple static landing page, so the Memory Bank should reflect this simplicity.
*   Focus on documenting the existing structure and functionality.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The project uses a clear separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for style, JS for interactivity).
*   Multilingual support is implemented client-side using `data-lang` attributes and `localStorage`.
*   Modal windows are used for user interaction (booking, contact).
